Installing and configuring a Web Development environment on a new computer is a lot of work, even for experienced web developers.

To make things simple for you and also give you real and powerful tools (rather than dummed down installation versions, that fall apart as soon as you branch out on your own) we're going to use a very popular and powerful development environment called vagrant.
